# Serializers Directory

The `serializers` directory contains classes and functions for transforming data between domain objects and formats suitable for external use, such as JSON, XML, or other protocols. Serializers ensure consistent and standardized data representation across the application.

## Purpose
The purpose of the `serializers` directory is to:
- Convert input data from external sources into formats usable by the application layer.
- Transform application or domain layer data into formats suitable for external clients.
- Ensure data consistency and standardization in communication.

## Structure
The directory organizes serializers by feature or module for clarity and maintainability:

```
interfaces/serializers/
|-- user_serializer.py        # Serializers for user-related data
|-- order_serializer.py       # Serializers for order-related data
|-- product_serializer.py     # Serializers for product-related data
```

## Principles
1. **Bidirectional Transformation:** Serializers should handle both serialization (domain to external format) and deserialization (external format to domain).
2. **Validation:** Validate and sanitize incoming data to ensure correctness before it reaches the application layer.
3. **Separation of Concerns:** Keep serialization logic separate from controllers and domain logic.

## Guidelines
- Use serializers to encapsulate all data transformation logic.
- Perform input validation in serializers to reduce redundancy in controllers.
- Use libraries like Pydantic, Marshmallow, or similar to simplify implementation.
- Keep serializers modular and focused on specific data models.

## Example
**Serializer: `user_serializer.py`**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr

class UserInputSerializer(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: EmailStr
    password: str

class UserOutputSerializer(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    email: str

    class Config:
        schema_extra = {
            "example": {
                "id": "123",
                "name": "John Doe",
                "email": "john.doe@example.com"
            }
        }
```

**Usage in Controller:**

```python
from interfaces.serializers.user_serializer import UserInputSerializer, UserOutputSerializer


@router.post("/users/register", response_model=UserOutputSerializer)
def register_user(request: UserInputSerializer):
    result = use_case.__call__(
        name=request.name,
        email=request.email,
        password=request.password
    )
    return UserOutputSerializer(id=result.id, name=result.name, email=result.email)
```

## Notes
The `serializers` directory is crucial for maintaining a clean and consistent data transformation pipeline. By centralizing this logic, you ensure that the application remains modular, testable, and easy to adapt to changes in data representation requirements.
