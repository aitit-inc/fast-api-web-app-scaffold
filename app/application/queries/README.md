# Queries Directory

The `queries` directory contains services and utilities for retrieving data in a read-only manner. These components are responsible for querying the system's data without modifying its state. The primary focus of this directory is to provide optimized and consistent ways to access information, often for reporting or read-heavy use cases.

## Purpose
- Retrieve data efficiently without altering the domain state.
- Isolate query logic from other application layers to maintain separation of concerns.
- Provide a unified interface for read operations.

## Directory Structure

```
queries/
|-- <query_service>.py  # Individual query services and utilities
```

### Query Services
Each file in this directory represents a specific query operation. These services:
- Interact with repositories or external data sources to fetch information.
- Ensure consistent query patterns across the application.
- Encapsulate complex query logic.

### Utilities
Shared logic for query-related tasks, such as filtering or pagination, can also be included in this directory. These utilities should be lightweight and reusable.

## Principles
1. **Read-Only Operations:** Queries should never modify the state of the system.
2. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize queries to minimize load on databases and external systems.
3. **Flat Structure:** Keep the directory flat to simplify navigation and organization.

## Guidelines
- Each file should focus on a single query or utility to improve readability and maintainability.
- Avoid embedding business rules in query services; these belong in the domain layer.
- Use caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to improve performance.
- Structure queries to handle large datasets efficiently, using pagination or batching where necessary.

## Example
**Query Service: `get_user_by_email.py`**
```python
from domain.repositories import UserRepository

def get_user_by_email(user_repository: UserRepository, email: str):
    return user_repository.find_by_email(email)
```

**Utility: `paginator.py`**
```python
def paginate(queryset, page: int, page_size: int):
    start = (page - 1) * page_size
    end = start + page_size
    return queryset[start:end]
```

## Notes
The `queries` directory ensures that data retrieval logic is cleanly separated from domain and application logic. By maintaining a flat structure, this directory becomes easier to navigate and manage. Adapt the structure and components as needed to meet the specific requirements of your project.
