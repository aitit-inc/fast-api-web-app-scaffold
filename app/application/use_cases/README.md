# Use Cases Directory

The `use_cases` directory contains application-level services that implement specific use cases of the system. Each use case corresponds to a distinct operation or action that the application performs, orchestrating the business logic in the domain layer and coordinating with other layers as needed.

## Purpose
- Define and implement application-specific operations or workflows.
- Coordinate domain logic and infrastructure to fulfill a specific use case.
- Serve as an entry point for external requests into the application's core logic.

## Directory Structure

```
use_cases/
|-- RegisterUser.py    # Example use case for registering a user
|-- UpdateUserProfile.py  # Example use case for updating a user profile
|-- DeleteOrder.py     # Example use case for deleting an order
|-- GetOrderDetails.py # Example use case for retrieving order details
```

## Principles
1. **Single Responsibility:** Each use case should handle only one specific operation or workflow.
2. **Orchestration:** Coordinate domain logic, repositories, and external services to complete the operation.
3. **Framework Independence:** Avoid embedding framework-specific logic; keep use cases reusable and testable.

## Guidelines
- Keep use cases lightweight by delegating logic to the domain layer and repositories.
- Clearly define the inputs and outputs for each use case using DTOs.
- Use dependency injection to provide required components (e.g., repositories, services).
- Avoid mixing read and write operations; use queries for read-only tasks.

## Example
**Use Case: `RegisterUser.py`**
```python
from domain.services import UserRegistrationService
from domain.repositories import UserRepository
from application.dto import RegisterUserInputDTO, RegisterUserOutputDTO

class RegisterUser:
    def __init__(self, user_repository: UserRepository, registration_service: UserRegistrationService):
        self.user_repository = user_repository
        self.registration_service = registration_service

    def execute(self, input_data: RegisterUserInputDTO) -> RegisterUserOutputDTO:
        user = self.registration_service.register(
            name=input_data.name,
            email=input_data.email,
            password=input_data.password
        )
        self.user_repository.save(user)
        return RegisterUserOutputDTO(id=user.id, email=user.email)
```

## Notes
The `use_cases` directory encapsulates the core workflows of the application in a flat structure to enhance simplicity and maintainability. By adhering to the single responsibility principle, this directory helps maintain clarity, testability, and scalability of the application.
